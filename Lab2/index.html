        <h1>My Favorite Songs</h1>
        <h2>A Drop In The Ocean by Ron Pope</h2>

        <p> My favorite song of all time is A Drop In The Ocean by Ron Pope. He is an independent artist and this is his most well known song. He rerecorded it a few times due to its popularity, but my favorite is the original version from his album called The Bedroom Demos. I love everything about the song from the story it tells, to the vocals, and especially the piano part. The song is really soft and beautiful because it's just him singing and the piano, it isn't overproduced in any way.</p>

        <h3>Boston by Augustana</h3>

        <p> In a close second is Boston by Augustana. This is Augustana's most popular song and was on their debut album called All The Stars and Boulevards. This song also features a heavy piano part and tells an emotional story. I played this song at a choir concert during my senior year of high school, so I will always remember it because of that too.</p>

        <h4>Under Control by Parachute</h4>
        <img src="Images/Parachute.jpg" alt="Losing Sleep" width="650" height="400">
        <p>My third favorite song is Under Control by Parachute which was on their debut album called Losing Sleep. This actually isn't one of their more popular songs, but I just really like it. This song doesn't have as much piano in it like my previous 2 choices, but I do like the guitar part a lot. To me all 3 songs fall into the genre of pop rock or soft rock which I really enjoy.</p>
