                <p>Of the three teams covered in depth, Oregon State is the biggest name and the school that more people will have likely heard of. This doesn't take away from what they achieved in the tournament though. Oregon State was projected to finish in last place in the Pac-12 Conference. They had to win their Conference Tournament to even make it to March Madness which they did. In the round of 64 Oregon State came in as a 12 seed and defeated 5 seed Tennessee by 14 points. In the next round they faced 4 seed Oklahoma State who were seen as a dark horse by many to make a long run. Oregon State stopped that from happening by pulling off another impressive victory by 10 points. In the Sweet Sixteen they won again by eliminating fellow underdog Loyola Chicago by 7 points. In the Elite Eight they faced arguably the toughest test yet by going up against 2 seed Houston. Oregon State was very competitive in the matchup, but went on to lose by 6 points. Of the three teams covered, Oregon State advanced the furthest in the tournament. </p>
