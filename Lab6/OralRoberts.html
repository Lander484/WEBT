                <p>Arguably the biggest underdog that saw success in this years tournament was Oral Roberts. In the round of 64 they defeated Ohio St becoming only the ninth team to pull off a 15 to 2 seed upset. This was also there first tournament win period since 1974. They weren't done there though because in the next round they won again against 7 seed Florida. A third successive win in the Sweet Sixteen would have seen them make history by becoming the lowest seeded team to ever reach the Elite Eight. However, this didn't come to be as they were narrowly defeated by 3 seed Arkansas. Ultimately, all three of Oral Roberts' tournament games were decided by three points or less. Previously, many people had probably never heard of Oral Roberts, but now they are on the map and will forever be remembered for the run they made. </p>
